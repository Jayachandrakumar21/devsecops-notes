CICD [ Continous Integration Continous Deployment

Continous Integration
--> It is the way of integrating the code from the source and creating artifacts we need to install dependencies, run unit test cases, scans, etc.
 Instead of doing it manually, we can automate it through a continuous integration process.

Example 
Manual Integration steps
-> Take one server
-> Git clone <url>
-> npm install  --> downloads dependencies
-> npm test --> unit test cases
-> sonar-scan
-> Zip --> Zip the application
-> store the application into some other artifact server
whereas in CI we can automate this process using Jenkins (one among the CICD tools)

installing Jenkins by using the below cmds

sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo \
    https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo
sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key
sudo yum upgrade --> You can skip this, as it takes too much time.
# Add required dependencies for the Jenkins package
sudo yum install fontconfig java-17-openjdk
sudo yum install jenkins
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

In Jenkins everything is called as job
